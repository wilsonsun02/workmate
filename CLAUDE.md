# CLAUDE.md

This document defines mandatory repository rules for Claude Code contributors in this project.
Treat this file as a team contract, not a suggestion list.

## 1) Mission and Scope

Workmate is an LLM-driven agent platform built around FastAPI + LangChain/LangGraph + MCP.
It supports:

- DeepAgent streaming workflows
- Desktop client runtime (`desktop/`)
- WeChat / WeChat Work automation
- Scheduler automation with execution tracking
- Multi-skill prompt/tool orchestration
- MCP-based filesystem and external tool integration

Primary backend entry is `serve.py` (default port `8009`).

## 2) Non-Negotiable Team Rules

1. Never leak or commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, credentials, DB passwords, private tokens).
2. Never hardcode machine-specific absolute paths unless the feature explicitly requires local runtime paths.
3. Keep behavior backward compatible unless explicitly asked to break it.
4. Minimize change surface; avoid unrelated refactors in feature/fix PRs.
5. Prefer configuration-driven behavior over hardcoded branch logic.
6. Keep comments and docs in English unless a file is intentionally Chinese-facing.
7. If uncertain about behavior, read code first and verify with executable checks.

## 3) Repository Map (Current)

### Core Runtime

- `serve.py`: FastAPI application assembly entry (startup init, middleware, router mounting, scheduler/admin mounting)
- `api/routers/`: route modules for desktop, quotation(SSE), mcp, skills
- `api/lifecycle.py`: FastAPI lifespan hooks (startup preload, MCP runtime self-check, shutdown cleanup)
- `api/runtime_config.py`: runtime env/config apply helpers (cloud config injection, output dir/wechat runtime sync)
- `api/runtime_state.py`: process runtime state (preload state, stream stop flags, chat locks/paths)
- `main.py`: CLI execution and scheduled invocation entry
- `workflow/`: DeepAgent execution, model binding, MCP middleware/client, infrastructure, config

### Desktop Stack

- `desktop/webview_shell.py`: PyQt desktop shell
- `desktop/ui/`: local SPA assets (`app.js`, `js/`, `css/`)
- `desktop/README.md`: desktop run/package operational details

### Admin + Scheduler

- `admin_api/`: admin/auth/config/skills server-side APIs
- `admin_web_v/apps/web-ele/`: admin frontend
- `scheduler/`: scheduler APIs, parser, executor, persistence, notification

### Integrations

- `wechat_work/`: WeChat Work WebSocket client and message handling
- `mcp_filesystem/`: local MCP server (document, file, Windows automation, media)
- `skills/`: skill packs
- `prompt/`: prompt templates

## 4) API Surface (Must Stay Consistent)

At minimum, verify compatibility for these route groups when editing app assembly/router flow (`serve.py`, `api/routers/*`, lifecycle hooks):

- `POST /quotation`
- `GET /agent/health`
- Desktop APIs under `/api/desktop/*`
- MCP config APIs under `/mcp/*`
- Skills APIs under `/skills/*`
- Scheduler APIs under `/scheduler/*`
- Admin router mounted via `admin_api`

If route behavior changes, update docs/tests in the same change.

## 5) Configuration and Environment

Single source of truth:

- Root `.env`
- `workflow/config.py`
- `config/mcp_servers.json`
- `config/mcp_operable_dirs.json`
- `config/scheduled_tasks.json`

Common sensitive variables include (non-exhaustive):

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `RUNLOOP_API_KEY`
- `REPORT_DB_HOST`, `REPORT_DB_DATABASE`, `REPORT_DB_USER`, `REPORT_DB_PASS`
- WeChat/WeChat Work credentials

Optional observability switch:

- `WORKMATE_LOG_STDOUT` (`1/true/yes/on`): duplicate Loguru output to stdout while still writing log files

Path safety and write permissions must respect:

- `MCP_READ_ALLOWED_DIRS`
- `MCP_WRITE_ALLOWED_DIRS`
- `OUTPUT_BASE_DIR`

## 6) Coding Standards

### Python

- Target Python `>= 3.12`.
- Follow PEP8 and existing repository style.
- Add type hints for new public functions whenever practical.
- Keep functions focused; split if a function grows beyond clear single responsibility.
- Use structured logging and preserve existing log semantics.
- Fail explicitly with actionable error messages.

### Logging (Loguru)

- Use `loguru` for all new and modified Python logging code. Prefer log statements over ad-hoc `print()` output.
- Standard log levels in this repository are restricted to: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.
- Use `DEBUG` for development diagnostics, detailed execution traces, and branch-level internal state.
- Use `INFO` for key business flow milestones and normal runtime lifecycle events.
- Use `ERROR` for failures that affect expected behavior; include actionable context and exception details.
- Keep logs structured and concise, avoid sensitive data in messages, and keep wording stable for downstream parsing/analysis.
- Reference: [Loguru Overview](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html).
- Central setup: [workflow/logging_setup.py](workflow/logging_setup.py) (`init_logging`, `resolve_logs_dir`). [serve.py](serve.py) and [desktop/webview_shell.py](desktop/webview_shell.py) call `init_logging` at startup.
- Log file directories: `serve` alone writes under `{BASE_DIR}/logs/serve.log`; desktop dev writes under `{cwd}/desktop_temp/logs/desktop.log`; frozen/packaged apps write under `{exe_dir}/logs/{app}.log`. Optional early bootstrap: [sitecustomize.py](sitecustomize.py) (when present on `PYTHONPATH` / project root) initializes logging for other entrypoints.
- Prefer `logger.info` over deprecated `logging.WARNING`-style usage; map former `warning` calls to `INFO` or `ERROR` by intent.

### JavaScript (Desktop/Admin)

- Keep modules small and composable.
- Avoid global mutable state unless the architecture requires it.
- Prefer explicit API adapters over inline fetch duplication.
- Preserve existing UX conventions (keyboard handling, stream rendering, modal behavior).

### Prompts and Skills

- Do not silently alter prompt intent.
- Document any behavior-affecting prompt changes in PR notes.
- Keep skill changes scoped and testable.

## 7) Change Workflow (Strict)

1. Read target files and adjacent callers before editing.
2. Implement the smallest correct change.
3. Run focused validation commands.
4. Update docs when behavior/config/API changed.
5. Ensure no secret or generated noise is included in commit.

## 8) Validation Checklist Before Merge

Run what is relevant to your change:

```bash
# Backend smoke start
python serve.py

# CLI smoke
python main.py

# Tests (preferred)
pytest
```

Desktop-related changes should also be sanity checked:

```bash
uv run --group desktop python -m desktop.webview_shell
```

If full test execution is not possible, document exactly what was verified and what remains.

## 9) File and Artifact Hygiene

Do not commit runtime artifacts unless explicitly requested:

- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- transient logs
- local DB/checkpoint snapshots generated during debug
- temp desktop workspace artifacts

When touching packaging/runtime files (`serve.spec`, `workmate-desktop.spec`, bundle scripts), verify that both development and packaged startup paths still work.

## 10) High-Risk Areas (Extra Care)

- `workflow/workflow_core.py` and `workflow/workflow_infrastructure.py`
- `workflow/mcpClient.py`, `workflow/robust_mcp_client.py`, `workflow/mcp_middleware.py`
- `serve.py` app composition and router mounting
- `api/routers/quotation.py` SSE streaming behavior
- `api/lifecycle.py` startup/shutdown ordering and resource cleanup
- `wechat_work/` message flow and auth
- scheduler execution and persistence paths
- desktop shell boot + backend auto-start coordination

For these files, add at least one concrete runtime check.

## 11) Documentation Contract

Any change that modifies one of these must update docs in the same PR:

- public API behavior
- required environment variables
- startup commands or packaging steps
- directory/path conventions for desktop/backend integration

Primary docs to keep aligned:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `desktop/README.md`
- `docs/admin-desktop-integration.md` (Admin WebSocket + desktop shell skills sync/install)
- relevant module README/docstrings

## 12) Definition of Done

A change is done only when:

1. Implementation is complete and scoped.
2. Relevant tests/checks pass or are explicitly explained.
3. Docs/config references are updated.
4. No secrets or accidental artifacts are included.
5. Diff is reviewable and focused on the intended outcome.
